# Real_Time_Prediction_of_Gamers_Behavior_Algorithms

This program summarizes the findings and conclusions reached while predicting gamer behavior in commercial gaming datasets. It specifically employs Variable-Order Markov (VOM) to construct a probabilistic model capable of inferring what gamers' upcoming actions will be based on their historical behavior.
Being able to accurately forecast the next user's activities may be of particular relevance in order to learn from the behavior of players, increase engagement, and minimize churn. To accommodate a high volume and velocity of data, the system is constructed on top of the Hadoop environment, with real-time processing handled by HBase; and the prediction tool is delivered as a service (SaaS) and accessible via a RESTful API.
